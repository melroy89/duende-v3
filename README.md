# MyBB Duende v3 theme (fully responsive)

Duende v3 theme fully responsive, free and open-source (GPL) for [MyBB](https://mybb.com/). Tested and works on MyBB v1.8.x.

Duende v3 comes in two flavours:

 - Duende v3
 - Duende v3 Local
 
 Duende V3 **Local** is the same as Duende V3, where the only difference is that with the local version all files are hosted locally. So *without* the need of a CDN (Cloudflare).
 
 In short, the Duende v3 **Local** is an ideal solution if you don't want to depend on external resources and/or don't have Internet access.
